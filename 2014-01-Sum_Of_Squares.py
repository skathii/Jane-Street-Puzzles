# Place a digit in each of the 25 spots in the below 5Ã—5 grid, so that each 5-digit number (leading zeroes are ok) reading across and reading down is divisible by the number outside the grid, trying to maximize the sum of the 25 numbers you enter. An example of a completed grid with sum 100 is presented on the right.
# Please submit your answer (along with any other comments you want to provide) as an ordered pair of your sum, and your 25 numbers, reading left to right, top to bottom.
# Example submission: (100,1623552460048932486847030)

# A || B || C || D || E  | 1
# F || G || H || I || J  | 2
# K || L || M || N || O  | 3
# P || Q || R || S || T  | 4
# U || V || W || X || Y  | 5
# ==========================
# 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10 | #

# Conditions:
# - Y has to be 0; any number divisible by both 5 and 10 has to end in 0.
# - J, T, U, W have to be even; those lines divisible by even numbers.

# Steps:
# 1. Create an array with all possible 5-digit values [00000, ..., 99999]
# 2. Use this list to filter out rows and columns divisible by [6,7,8,9,10] and by the previous listed conditions.
# 3. Select a value from each array to create new numbers via the index of the selected and check if they're divisible by 1,2,3,4,5.
# 4. If not, change a value and try again. Iterate through until we get a match.

# Once we get a large n, we can iterate through millions of combinations to get the biggest value. 

# Problems with this function:
# - Currently this function runs very slowly, mainly due to the all_combos array generation.
# - If we want to get the true maximum sum of digits, we would need to iterate through them all.
# - By increasing the value of n to the maximum, This will take a VERY long time.
# - If we created a combo list of the largest 1000 values from each list, and it took one second per 1000 combinations, it would take 31,709.8 years.

# Optimising:
# - Instead of directly creating the all_combos list, we could just create a function to iterate through the combos and check if they are divisible by 1,2,3,4,5.
# - Additionally, we could calculate the sum of the digits in real time and not consider any that are less than or equal to our current max value.
