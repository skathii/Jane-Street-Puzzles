# In the grid below, enter nine 9’s in the outermost hook, eight 8’s in the next hook, then seven 7’s, six 6’s, and so on, down to the one 1 (already entered), so that the row and column sums match the values given along the border.
# Once you’ve completed the puzzle, submit as your answer the sum of the values of the shaded squares (along with any other comments you’d like to provide).

# Steps:
# 1.
# - Column 5 has a value of 5 and it takes a minimum value of 5, meaning one of the slots will take a value.
# - This means row 5 will take 4 of the 5 values. We can also block out column 5 row 6,7,8 and 9.
# 2. 
# - Column 4 has a value of 16 and with 5 already there, we need 11 more.
# - We only have 4 4's, 6, 7, 8 and 9 to pick from to make this.
# - We can make 11 from one 4 and 7; we can put the 7 in but not the 4 as we do not know wherei t could go.
# - This also means we can block out column 4 row 6, 8 and 9.
# 3.
# - Row 7 needs a total of 29 and we need 22 more.
# - We have 4 7's, 8 and 9 available to make 22; we can use 2 7's and 8.
# - We do not know the positions except for the 8 so we can add that to Column 8.
# - We can block out 9 for Column 9 Row 8.
# 4. 
# - Column 8 requires 49, we have 8, need 41 more.
# - We have 7 8's and a 9 to pick from. We definitely need the 9 so we can put that in.
# 5. 
# Row 8 requires 32 from 6 8's and a 9. 
# It can't be 9 so we can block that out on Column 9.
# 6.
# - Column 7 has a total of 28 and we can pick from 7 7's, 8 and 9.
# - We can't make 28 from  or 9 so we can block them on Row 8 and 9.
# 7.
# - Row 6 needs a total of 36; we have 4 6's, 7, 8 and 9 to make it.
# - We can only make 36 from 2 6's, 7, 8 and 9 for this row.
# - We don't know the positions of the 6's but we can block out the 7, 8 and 9.
# 8. 
# - Column 7 requires 47 and we can pick from 6 6's, 7, 8 and 9.
# - We can make this from 5 6's, 8 and 9. We can fill in 8 and 9 but not the 6's.
# 9.
# - Column 4 requires 16, need 4 and we have 4 4's.
# - Although we don't know where the 4 goes, we know the remaining 3 have to be in row 4.
# - We can add the 4's to column 1, 2, and 3.
# 10.
# - Column 2 requires 19 and we have a total of 9, needing 10.
# - As we don't have a value of 1 to pick from, 9 cannot be an option so we can block it.
# 11.
# - Row 9 can be completed as the missing slots can be filled with 9 to make 45.
# 12.
# - Column 1 requires 31 with 19 confirmed. We have 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8 to make 12.
# - The only way we can make it with these numbers is from 2, 3 and 7. We can block 6 and 8 in column 1.
# 13.
# - Row 8 requires 32, we have one 8 and the 3 remaining slots can take 8. We can add them all.
# 14.
# - Row 4 requires 22 and we already have 3 4's to make 12. We need 10 more and we have 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.
# - Because we have 10 remaining, we can block 7, 8 and 9. This is because we don't have 3, 2 or 1 to make 22.
# - This also means we have 4, 5 and 6 left to make 10. We can add 4 and 6 to make 10 and block 5.
# 15.
# - Column 4 equals 16 with the last 4 added so we can block the rest of the column out.
# 16.
# - Row 3 requires a total of 11 with 3 already a value, meaning we need to make 8 from 2 3's, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.
# - We can only do this with the 8, add it in and block out the rest of the row.
# 17.
# - Column 9 requires 45, we have 18 and the 3 remaining slots can be filled with 9; add them in.
# 18.
# - Column 2 requires 19 and we have 17, needing to make 2 more from 2 2's, 6 and 7.
# - As we can't use 6 or 7, we can block them out.
# 19.
# - Row 6 requires 36, we have 24, needing 12 from 2 6's. We can add them in as they make 12.
# 20.
# - Column 3 requires 45 and we have 32. We need 13 from 2 3's and 7. We can make 13 from all of these so add them.
# 21.
# - Row 7 needs 29 and we have got 29 from filling previous rows. Block out the rest.
# 22.
# - Column 7 requires 28, we have 7 and the final 3 slots can be filled with 7 to match our total. Add them in.
# 23.
# - Row 5 requires 42 and we have 36; we need 6 more from 5, 6 and 8. We can add the 6 and block out the 5 and 8.
# 24.
# - Column 6 requires 47 and we have 35; we can make the remaining 12 from the final 2 6's. Add them.
# 25.
# - Row 2 requires 42 and we have 27; we can make 15 from the remaining 2, 5 and 8. Add them.
# 26.
# - Finally, Row 1 requires 26 and we have a total of 26 already. Block out the remaining squares!


# We need to identify the shaded blocks of the grid and add them together:
